# Qubik: A Python Container Orchestrator

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

Qubik is an **educational project** focused on building a lightweight container orchestrator from scratch using **Python**. It's directly inspired by Tim Boring's excellent book, ["Build an Orchestrator in Go From Scratch"](https://www.manning.com/books/build-an-orchestrator-in-go-from-scratch).

The primary goal is to **understand the core principles** of container orchestration tools like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and Nomad by reimplementing their fundamental components in Python. While directly translating Go logic to Python presents challenges due to syntax differences and my shortage of Python knowledge, this project aims to provide practical insights into orchestration architecture.
